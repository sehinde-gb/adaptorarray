## Advent of Code 2020 Day10

- Day 11: Adaptor Array


## Description

- Patched into the aircraft's data port, you discover weather forecasts of a massive tropical storm. 
- Before you can figure out whether it will impact your vacation plans, however, your device suddenly turns off!

- Its battery is dead.

- You'll need to plug it in. There's only one problem: the charging outlet near your seat produces the wrong number of jolts. 
- Always prepared, you make a list of all of the joltage adapters in your bag.
